  <h3>Beginner at the gym</h3>

<p class="inf">One mistake a lot of beginners do is starting too hard. A person who has never gone to the gym might suddenly start going there five times a week but soon they end up quitting. 
  It's a rather common pattern seen especially around the new year, and the main reason it happens is that they haven't actually built a new habit, but instead started doing something unsustainable.
<br><br> As a beginner, a person should primarily focus on building a new habit. Consistent habits are usually created slowly, and this would apply to exercising as well.
Instead of jumping on the motivation high and pushing themselves to their limits, new gymgoers should ask themselves: "What can I do forever, and not only for two weeks?"
<br><br>A better approach than doing everything you can is for example to start by going once a week to get used to it and create consistency. Over time, as going to the gym starts to be a part of their weekly routine, they might add another gym day to the week or perhaps work out for 15 minutes longer.
Progress can look different for different people, but with devotion and a realistic approach, eventually working out can become a frequent part of their lives.
<br><br> And if you were about to ask: No, you will not get bulky overnight after lifting - I wish you could! Gaining that much muscle takes a huge amount of work. </p></article>
<article><div class="alku1"><img src="/img/deadlift.jpg"> <p> What type of exercises should a beginner focus on?</p></div><br>
  <p class="inf">The best way for most beginners to go about starting going to the gym is to concentrate on practising compound exercises. These include for example:
   <ul><li>Squat</li>
    <li>Deadlift</li>
    <li>Bench press</li>
    <li>Hip thrust</li>
    <li>Shoulder press</li>
    <li>Row</li></ul>
    Compound exercises refer to the kind of movements which use multiple muscle groups. So they're generally seen as more effective than isolation exercises. 
    If a beginner starts with short occasional workouts, compound exercises allow them to so-calledly cover more ground and get the most out of their sessions! </p>
