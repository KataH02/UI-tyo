    Nutrition is an important part of our well-being, but it's good to mention that it doesn't mean you have to be obsessive about it. 
    Thriving to be healthier doesn't mean pushing to be perfect, which could end up being bad for the individual's mental well-being. For most people, improving nutrition is simply about making small and sustainable changes towards being a bit healthier. This doesn't have to be exclusive, like never eating chocolate anymore, but it can instead be inclusive, for example, eating more vegetables or healthy proteins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like with exercising, sustainability is a major factor in our eating habits. Extreme diets rarely last for long, and they usually aren't actually the healthiest either. What a person could do, however, would be to 
    gradually start including more healthy eating habits. 
    Starting could be as simple as drinking more water, eating more vegetables, paying attention to your protein intake and trying to include less ultra-processed foods such as chips, fast food or microwave meals (this doesn't mean they have to cut them out entirely)!
  </p>
  <p class="protein">
    Protein is THE macronutrient for gym goers - the one most of us gym goers focus on. While some bodybuilders should perhaps chill out and put the protein shakes down (you don't need 300 grams of protein, at this point you're just harming your kidneys, dude), there's still a lot of truth to the importance of protein - especially for a gym goer. Protein is made up of amino acids, which your body uses for example to build muscle and repair muscle fibres. Simply put, it helps with muscle growth and recovery. This is the reason why the recommended daily protein intake is higher for athletes. So if a person starts to go to the gym regularly, they should pay more attention to their protein intake. A recommended amount for athletes who don't have a significantly high body fat percentage is a little debated, but it would be around 1.8 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. A person going to the gym once or twice a week (who isn't obese) could aim for 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight.
